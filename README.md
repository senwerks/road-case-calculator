# Road Case Calculator

## Description

This is a very simple calculator for helping you figure out what hardware you need to buy to build a custom A/V roadcase to your own dimeniosn.

I made this for my own personal usage, so it's not very polished. But it works for me, and I hope it works for you too.

## TODO

[ ] - Let user choose extrusion lengths available at their supplier, then calculate "lengths to order"
[ ] - Make it less ugly
[ ] - Add better explanation of how to use the output, allow for kerf/waste, example cuts for lid, etc
[ ] - Generate plans/diagrams?
[ ] - Scrape and generate prices?

## Reference

This is the raw list of hardware that I use to build my own roadcases, and that the calculator is based on. It specs a standard roadcase with 9mm plywood, piano-hinged top lid with 2 recessed butterfly latches, 2 recessed handles, and flat (not ball-style) corners as I prefer those.
